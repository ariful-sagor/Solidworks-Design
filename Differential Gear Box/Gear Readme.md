# Differential Gear Box Design

This project contains the SolidWorks files for a differential gear box, an essential component in most automotive drivetrains.

## Overview

A differential gear box is a crucial part of a vehicle's drivetrain, allowing the wheels to rotate at different speeds while maintaining control and stability, particularly during cornering. This design aims to provide a detailed and accurate representation of a differential gear box suitable for various applications.

## Features

- **Differential Mechanism**: The gear box incorporates a differential mechanism to distribute torque evenly between the wheels while allowing them to rotate at different speeds.
- **Bevel Gears**: Utilizes bevel gears to transfer power from the input shaft to the differential mechanism, ensuring smooth and efficient operation.
- **Housing Design**: The housing is designed to provide structural integrity while allowing easy access for maintenance and repairs.
- **Precision Engineering**: Designed using SolidWorks, the components are modeled with precision to ensure functionality and compatibility with standard manufacturing processes.
- **Modular Components**: The gear box consists of modular components, facilitating assembly, disassembly, and customization.

## Files

The repository contains the following files:

- **Assembly Files**: SolidWorks assembly files (.sldasm) showcasing the complete differential gear box assembly.
- **Part Files**: Individual part files (.sldprt) for each component of the gear box.
- **Drawing Files**: Technical drawing files (.slddrw) providing detailed dimensions and annotations for manufacturing.

## Usage

Feel free to explore the design files and use them for educational, research, or personal projects. You can also modify and enhance the design to suit specific requirements or integrate it into larger assemblies.
