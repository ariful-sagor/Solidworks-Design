# Quadcopter Drone Design

This repository contains the Solidworks design files for a quadcopter drone.

## Overview

The quadcopter drone is designed with the following key components:

- **Frame**: The structural body of the drone, is designed to be lightweight yet sturdy to support other components.
- **Motors**: Four brushless DC motors are used for propulsion.
- **Propellers**: Each motor is paired with a propeller to generate lift and thrust.
- **Electronic Speed Controllers (ESCs)**: These control the speed and direction of the motors.
- **Flight Controller**: The brain of the drone, responsible for stabilizing the aircraft and managing flight modes.
- **Battery**: Provides power to all electronic components.

## Files

The repository contains the following files:

- **Assembly Files**: SolidWorks assembly files (.sldasm) that showcase the complete engine assembly.
- **Part Files**: Individual part files (.sldprt) for each component of the engine.
